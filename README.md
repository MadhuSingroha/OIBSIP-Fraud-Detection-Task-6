### Credit Card Fraud Detection | Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.
The dataset is highly imbalanced, making it a real-world challenge for classification models.

#### 🚀 Project Overview

- Loaded and explored the Credit Card Fraud dataset

- Preprocessed the data to handle imbalance using SMOTE

- Trained multiple ML models:

- Logistic Regression

- Random Forest



***📂 Dataset***

#### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python

- NumPy

- Pandas

- Matplotlib & Seaborn

- Scikit-learn

- SMOTE (Imbalanced-Learn)

#### 📊 Key Insights

The dataset contains 284,807 transactions but only 492 fraud cases

Significant class imbalance handled using SMOTE

Random Forest/XGBoost showed the best performance (modify based on your results)

#### 🏁 Results

- Achieved strong recall for fraud detection

- Built a reliable fraud classification model

- Improved performance by handling imbalance
